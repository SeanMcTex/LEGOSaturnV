# LEGO Saturn V Rocket Display

This is the code and sound file that I used to create my [LEGO Saturn V Rocket Display](https://www.mcmains.net/work/maker-projects/lego-saturn-v-rocket-display/).

- The `RGB_Rocket` folder contains the Arduino code that drives the whole show. It expects to be connected to a NeoPixel light strip as well as to an Adafruit sound module. (See the linked article for details.)
- `T00.ogg` is the sound file that is loaded into the sound module.

Hit me up if you have any questions!
