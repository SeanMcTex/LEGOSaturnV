# LEGO Saturn V Rocket Display

This is the code and sound file that I used to create my [LEGO Saturn V Rocket Display](https://www.mcmains.net/work/maker-projects/lego-saturn-v-rocket-display/).

- The `RGB_Rocket` folder contains the Arduino code that drives the whole show. It expects to be connected to a NeoPixel light strip as well as to an Adafruit sound module. (See the linked article for details.)
- `T00.ogg` is the sound file that is loaded into the sound module.
- `LED Shield v2.f3d` is a Fusion 360 model of the little light shields to direct the upward-pointing LEDs appropriately. Intended for 3D printing.
- `Rocket Platform v8.f3d` includes Fusion 360 designs both for the platform that the rocket sits on and the support bracket to hold the upper portion in place. Intended for CNC milling.

Hit me up if you have any questions!
